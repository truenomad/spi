# blindspot 0.1.0

* Added `bs_field_guide()`: reads every district-year through the paper's
  seven-signal interpretation protocol (S1-S7) and assigns a FLAG / WATCH /
  No-action verdict, degrading gracefully when the optional adjacency,
  monthly-SPI, or genomic inputs are absent.
* Added `bs_field_guide_table()` to render the field guide as a `gt` or
  `flextable` table (scan or worked-example layout, concern shading), with
  file export inferred from the extension (html / docx / pdf / rtf / png /
  pptx).
* Added `bs_field_guide_help()`, a console interpretation aid: the seven
  signals, the flag rule, common misreadings, and a live worked example
  narrated from real signal values.
* Added `bs_triangulate()`: crosses the field-guide verdict against
  independent virus detection (AFP and environmental surveillance) to
  separate a trustworthy silence from a probable blind spot, with a
  three-level triage priority and a `detection_lag` to read the verdict
  before any response amplified it.
* Added `bs_triangulate_table()` and `bs_triangulate_map()` to render the
  triangulation as a `gt` / `flextable` table or a district choropleth
  (ten-class or coarse-priority fill).
* Added the `synth_field_guide` dataset -- a precomputed field guide on
  `synth_surveillance` so the help, examples, and tests run without INLA.
* Added `bs_expected(overdispersion = "auto")`, which runs the
  `bs_compare_overdispersion()` comparison internally and refits with the
  best-calibrated specification (now noted in the README).
* Expanded the test suite to ~99% coverage: the downstream functions and
  their S3 methods now run off constructed fixtures with no INLA fit, and
  the model-fit path is exercised by small INLA-gated integration tests.
